# Zblinder Shell

## What ?

Zblinder Shell is (aimed at being) an ARPG game set in a fantasy world, not unlike she Souls series/The Witcher in terms of gameplay, and probably too close to D&D for it to be legally viable.

## Why ?

Cuz I'm bored, and I want to train at Godot and Blender. Also, I've got lots of idea zooming around my mind that I never take the time to put on paper, so here it is !

## How ?

- Godot Engine for the core game
- Blender for modeling and animation
- Probably some AI shid at some point, if I need portraits, or pointlessly lengthy discourses and sentences constituted of complex yet utterly useless vocabulary.
  - Not just any AI tho, I'd use my own PC instance and CivitAI models.
