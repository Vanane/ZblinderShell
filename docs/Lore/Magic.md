# Magic

​	In the common language, magic is an umbrella term which designates any form of mystical powers and abilities, including arts of divination, miracles, spell casting, among others.
To the average creature, many of these abilities look and feel unnatural : one may be able to burn an entire tree down, from a simple snap of their fingers, or could defy gravity through spectacular levitation. Other forms, although less spectacular, would leave a lot to speculate on still, such as divination, for instance reading one's future events into their hand wrinkles.

​	In reality, magic is a very concrete concept. magic composes everything that lives. In fact, Magic is a substance, that is secreted by all organisms. Some organisms produce more than others, and even members of a same species can produce a very wide range of this substance. Some can't produce it at all, and some are overwhelmed with it. This substance, just like blood and sap, runs through a critter's internal channels, be it human veins, or a tree's xylems.
This substance is the source of all of the energy necessary to summon any form of spells. Divination, summons, fireballs, levitation, illusions, shapeshifting, etc...

The substance can be seen as some kind of extremely potent calorific liquid that is produced by living creatures. When a creature casts a spell, the substance gets depleted from its energy (or heat), which in turn solidifies, or cristallizes, similarly to water turning into ice. Though the difference in temperature isn't nearly as large. Thus, after a spellcact, the skin feels a bit colder, and the limbs are chilled down silghtly.
This above behaviour implies that using lots of energy at once will cristallize lots of substance inside one's body. Given enough time, the substance slowly melts, and turns back into a liquid. But in the event of a greedy individual, one could cristallizes its entire reserves, which in turn would freeze their blood, and effectively kill them if not taken care of in the minute.

A mage with high levels of this substance will be able to store much more energy, and cast much more potent spells than other mages. Someone without a single drop of this substance won't be able to cast anything, at all.
Some individuals are known to have extremely potent magic, thanks to massive reserves of that substance. Though, if untamed and untrained, one could overuse their power raw without any limitations. In that case, the substance cristallizing wouldn't just kill them; the sheer amount of it might provoke a spectacular cristalline explosion, impaling and stabbing their body from inside out, turning them into a morbid artwork.









# Idées

Divination :

- Comme les orks de 40k : le fait de faire de la divination est à la fois la cause et la conséquence de ce qui est lu.
  Si un chiromancien lit de façon authentique et désintéressée un événement futur, celui-ci arrivera, d'une forme ou d'une autre.
  - Le fait de l'avoir lu déclenchera l'existence de la timeline contenant cet événement.
  - Ne pas le lire ne signifie pas que l'événement n'aura jamais lieu, mais il n'aura probablement pas lieu de la même façon, ni au même moment, ni avec les mêmes éléments.
  - Chercher à dire ou à faire dire au praticien l'occurrence d'un événement par une quelconque manipulation. Par exemple, le client forme de faux plis de la main pour tromper le praticien, ou bien le praticien disant autre chose que ce qu'il a lu, ou bien le maître du praticien lui donnant de faux savoirs quant à la lecture des plis : ces situations forcent un événement, d'une manière ou d'une autre, directement ou non. La lecture qui est faite se révèle donc complètement fausse.
  - La divination est finalement l'utilisation inconsciente, involontaire et immaîtrisable de la magie, afin de modifier le futur. Ce qui implique qu'un chiromancien cristallise son sang pour modifier le futur.
